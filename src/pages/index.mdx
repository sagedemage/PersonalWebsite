Hi, my name is Salmaan Saeed. I'm an alumni of **New Jersey Institute of
Technology**. I have a Bachelor of Science in **Information Technology**. I
have desktop support and front-end experience from my internships with Shoptaki
and Jabil. I have experience maintaining a Raspberry Pi LDAP server. I wanted to
learn how to utilize an OpenLDAP server in order to use a directory service like
Active Directory. I used my time to learn about Active Directory and its network
topology. I have experience setting up a Kubernetes cluster with Docker. I
learned about container orachestration and how it helps DevOps Engineers
automate the process of deployment, management, and networking of containers. I
took my time to learn about the architecture of a Kubernetes clsuter. My goal is
to become a Desktop Support Technician. My long term goal is to become a System
Administrator.

## My Values

Unlike most Americans, I value collectivism more than individualism.

Here are my **values**:

- Respect your elders and take care of them
- Sometimes, you have to sacrifice your freedom in order to improve the
  wellbeing of your family.
- Make sure to maintain a strong bond with your family.
- Stay in touch with your family during hardtimes and struggles.
